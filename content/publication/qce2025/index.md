abstract: 'This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of a larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.'
